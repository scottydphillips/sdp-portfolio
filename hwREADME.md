#README

Description: This page is my portfolio webpage for sites and applications that I have developed during my time in Georgia Tech's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

How to use this: Scroll through the site, click on the links, mouse over the images and textboxes, or resize to check its responsiveness.

Why I built this: I built this to showcase my work and to bolster my job applications to obtain a Full Stack Engineer or Developer position.

Cool CSS things: Opacity on all images, z-indexing to overlay the app links, responsive resizing of section images.

Other things: All images are from my life as a professional musician. The figure under the header was an exercise I completed with students in my Music Theory class. All others are from concerts or photoshoots for promotional materials.
